# Express Server Application

This project utilizes principles of REST for managing food data.
All data is stored locally in an array and as a result will be cleared upon browser-refresh.
To test these routes I created a ready-to-go template in the "route.rest" file which you can use
by installing the REST Client extension by Huachao Mao

## Data categories

Each category is filled with their respective data
